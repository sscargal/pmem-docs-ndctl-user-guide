## NAME

daxctl−reconfigure−device − Reconfigure a dax device into a different mode

## SYNOPSIS

_daxctl reconfigure−device_  &lt;dax0.0&gt; \[&lt;dax1.0&gt;...&lt;daxY.Z&gt; \[&lt;options&gt;\]

## EXAMPLES

• Reconfigure dax0.0 to system−ram mode, don’t online the memory

```text
# daxctl reconfigure-device --mode=system-ram --no-online dax0.0
[
 {
   "chardev":"dax0.0",
   "size":16777216000,
   "target_node":2,
   "mode":"system-ram"
 }
]
```

• Reconfigure dax0.0 to devdax mode, attempt to offline the memory

```text
# daxctl reconfigure-device --human --mode=devdax --force dax0.0
{
 "chardev":"dax0.0",
 "size":"15.63 GiB (16.78 GB)",
 "target_node":2,
 "mode":"devdax"
}
```

• Reconfigure all dax devices on region0 to system−ram mode

```text
# daxctl reconfigure-device --mode=system-ram --region=0 all
[
 {
   "chardev":"dax0.0",
   "size":16777216000,
   "target_node":2,
   "mode":"system-ram"
 },
 {
   "chardev":"dax0.1",
   "size":16777216000,
   "target_node":3,
   "mode":"system-ram"
 }
]
```

• Run a process called _some−service_ using numactl to restrict its cpu nodes to _0_ and _1_, and memory allocations to node 2 \(determined using daxctl\_dev\_get\_target\_node\(\) or _daxctl list_\)

```text
# daxctl reconfigure-device --mode=system-ram dax0.0
[
 {
   "chardev":"dax0.0",
   "size":16777216000,
   "target_node":2,
   "mode":"system-ram"
 }
]

# numactl --cpunodebind=0-1 --membind=2 -- some-service --opt1 --opt2
```

## DESCRIPTION

Reconfigure the operational mode of a dax device. This can be used to convert a regular _devdax_ mode device to the _system−ram_ mode which arranges for the dax range to be hot−plugged into the system as regular memory.

**Note**  
This is a destructive operation. Any data on the dax device **will** be lost.

**Note**  
Device reconfiguration depends on the dax−bus device model. See daxctl−migrate−device−model\(1\) for more information. If dax−class is in use \(via the dax\_pmem\_compat driver\), the reconfiguration will fail with an error such as the following:

```text
# daxctl reconfigure-device --mode=system-ram --region=0 all
libdaxctl: daxctl_dev_disable: dax3.0: error: device model is dax-class
dax3.0: disable failed: Operation not supported
error reconfiguring devices: Operation not supported
reconfigured 0 devices
```

daxctl-reconfigure-device nominally expects that it will online new memory blocks as movable, so that kernel data doesn’t make it into this memory. However, there are other potential agents that may be configured to automatically online new hot-plugged memory as it appears. Most notably, these are the /sys/devices/system/memory/auto\_online\_blocks configuration, or system udev rules. If such an agent races to online memory sections, daxctl checks if the blocks were onlined as movable memory. If this was not the case, and the memory blocks are found to be in a different zone, then a warning is displayed. If it is desired that a different agent control the onlining of memory blocks, and the associated memory zone, then it is recommended to use the --no-online option described below. This will abridge the device reconfiguration operation to just hotplugging the memory, and refrain from then onlining it.

## OPTIONS

−r, −−region=

Restrict the operation to devices belonging to the specified region\(s\). A device−dax region is a contiguous range of memory that hosts one or more /dev/daxX.Y devices, where X is the region id and Y is the device instance id.

−m, −−mode=

Specify the mode to which the dax device\(s\) should be reconfigured.

• "system−ram": hotplug the device into system memory.

• "devdax": switch to the normal "device dax" mode. This requires the kernel to support hot−unplugging _kmem_ based memory. If this is not available, a reboot is the only way to switch back to _devdax_ mode.

−N, −−no−online

By default, memory sections provided by system−ram devices will be brought online automatically and immediately with the _online\_movable_ policy. Use this option to disable the automatic onlining behavior.

--no-movable 

--movable is the default. This can be overridden to online new memory such that is is not movable. This allows any allocation to potentially be served from this memory. This may preclude subsequent removal. With the --movable behavior \(which is default\), kernel allocations will not consider this memory, and it will be reserved for application use.

−f, −−force

When converting from "system−ram" mode to "devdax", it is expected that all the memory sections are first made offline. By default, daxctl won’t touch online memory. However with this option, attempt to offline the memory on the NUMA node associated with the dax device before converting it back to "devdax" mode.

−u, −−human

By default the command will output machine−friendly raw−integer data. Instead, with this flag, numbers representing storage size will be formatted as human readable strings with units, other fields are converted to hexadecimal strings.

−v, −−verbose

Emit more debug messages
